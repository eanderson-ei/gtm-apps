# Data Catalog

**A searchable Google Sheets-based data catalog**

---

The Data Catalog is simple Google Apps Script search front end for a collection of data assets with Bootstrap styling.  The Data Catalog is a component of the USAID/Guatemala Data Hub. Find it at [sites.google.com/guatemala-data-hub](https://www.sites.google.com/guatemala-data-hub).

## How to get it

To replicate this project:

1. Organize your data assets in a Google Drive folder (or any other method you prefer) such that each data asset has its own unique hyperlink. 
2. Copy this [Data Inventory template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uZEq8SEx9LTki4XknoDsio4JdyHGJOf1zJbvF56iieM/copy)* and populate with an inventory of your data assets, providing the hyperlink to each asset in the *Asset Link* column.
   * The **providers** sheet (optional) lists all data sources
   * The **directory** sheet lists all data assets
3. Create a new Google Apps Script project and copy the Apps Script code found in the `scripts/standalone` directory. We recommend using `clasp`, see guidance below.

*The Data Inventory template includes a containerized version of this script that adds a **Search** menu and *Search Datasets* menu item to launch the search bar as a modal dialog. A copy of this code can be found in the `scripts/containerized` directory.

### Organizing data assets on Google Drive

Our file organization looks like this:

```
.
+-- raw/
+-- tabular/
    +-- theme1.gsheet
    +-- theme2.gsheet
+-- spatial/
    +-- shapefiles/
        +-- file1.shp
        +-- file2.shp
    +-- geojson/
        +-- file1.geojson
+-- Data_Inventory.gsheet
```

* The `raw/` directory store all data as it was downloaded. 
* The `tabular/` directory stores all 2-dimensional data in Google Sheets. Data are organized by theme, and multiple sheets are used to capture all related data assets. A link to each sheet can be generated by appending the sheet ID to the access link (just navigate to the sheet in your browser and copy the full link).
* The `spatial/` directory includes all spatial files, organized by file type.

You may organize your files in any way you prefer or even link directly to an online source provided each asset can be assigned a unique hyperlink. If you would like to extend the Data Catalog with the Map Viewer project, a related application that displays tabular data on a map, first review the Map Viewer project's documentation as additional constraints will apply.

### Using clasp with Google Apps Script

Review this [guide](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/clasp) on using clasp with Google Apps Script. Your organization may prevent the use of `clasp` by restricting access to your Google account.
